This project describes a bag-of-words approach for business invoice recognition. Bags of potential features are generated to capture layout and textual properties for each field of interest, and weighted to reveal key factors that identify a field. Feature selection, threshold tuning, and model comparison are evaluated. Overall, we achieved 8.81\% for training error and 13.99\% for testing error.
