\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
Overall, SVM produced the best results because it does not make unnecessary assumptions like Naive Bayes does, and can intelligently find the best margin separating two classes.\\

If we had more time, we would explore more ways to handle overfitting, which includes expanding training data size, and using wrapper model feature selection for more precise results. Further analysis might be worthwhile on the effectiveness of the current set of feature selection rules in capturing the inherent nature of invoice layout, and perform rule-level feature selection on a larger pool of potential feature generation rules. Additionally, current results are largely affected by poor OCR performance, which suggests investigation on more optimized OCR tools or collection of higher quality invoice images.
